# AGENTS.md

A living guide to the AI (and human) roles that help us build a **clean, event-driven Todo application** using **test-driven development (TDD)** and industry best practices.

---

## Shared Principles

* **TDD first.** Write (or update) a failing test before production code. Red → Green → Refactor.
* **Event-driven thinking.** Model behavior as **commands → state transitions → domain events**.
* **DDD & Clean Architecture.** Ubiquitous language, clear boundaries (domain, application, infrastructure).
* **Quality by design.** SOLID, small cohesive modules, intention-revealing names, no duplication.
* **Minimal change.** Do the simplest thing that can possibly work, then improve safely.
* **Document as we go.** Public APIs and domain events get documented alongside code.

---

## Core Vocabulary

* **Command** — an intention: `CreateTodo`, `RenameTodo`, `CompleteTodo`, `ScheduleDueDate`.
* **Aggregate** — consistency boundary: `Todo`, `Project`, `Tag`.
* **Event** — something that happened: `TodoCreated`, `TodoRenamed`, `TodoCompleted`, `DueDateScheduled`, `TodoReopened`, `TodoDeleted`, `TagAddedToTodo`, `TagRemovedFromTodo`.
* **Read model** — query-optimized projections: e.g., “Today’s Tasks”, “Overdue by Project”.

Keep names past-tense for events, imperative for commands, and align with ubiquitous language.

---

## Collaboration Protocol

1. **Frame the change** (a user story + acceptance criteria).
2. **Event-storm quickly** (what events *should* happen? any invariants?).
3. **Write a failing test** (unit first; add integration/E2E if needed).
4. **Make it pass** with the smallest change.
5. **Refactor safely** (behavior preserved; improve design).
6. **Document** (event docs + public API snippets).
7. **Commit & PR** (reference events, include test evidence).

**Commit message template**

```
feat(todo): emit TodoCompleted when completing a not-done item

- Adds command handler CompleteTodo
- Emits TodoCompleted; guards against double-complete
- Updates projections: Today and Completed counts

Events: TodoCompleted
Tests: TodoAggregate.spec.ts (3 new), Projections.spec.ts (1 updated)
```

**PR checklist**

* [ ] New/updated failing tests existed first
* [ ] Only minimal production code to pass tests
* [ ] Events named and documented
* [ ] Public API examples included
* [ ] No leaky infrastructure details in domain layer

## Agent Roster

Each “agent” is a focused hat you (and I) can put on. Invoke one by name with a short brief.

### 1) Pair Programmer (Lead)

**Mission:** Co-design and implement features via tight TDD loops.
**Strengths:** Breaking work into small steps, naming, refactoring.
**Primary Outputs:** Failing tests → minimal passing code → refactors.
**Guardrails:** No production code without a failing test.

**Activation prompt:**
“**Pair Programmer:** given this story, guide me test-first and propose the smallest next step.”

---

### 2) Event-Storming Facilitator

**Mission:** Map commands, aggregates, events, and invariants.
**Strengths:** Ubiquitous language, boundary discovery.
**Primary Outputs:** Event list, command→event mapping, aggregate notes.
**Guardrails:** No persistence talk; stay at domain level.

**Activation prompt:**
“**Event-Storming:** for *\[story]*, propose commands, events, invariants, and edge cases.”

---

### 3) Test Engineer

**Mission:** Design crisp tests and edge cases before code.
**Strengths:** Given-When-Then, property tests, coverage with minimal overlap.
**Primary Outputs:** Unit/integration test outlines and data sets.
**Guardrails:** Tests describe behavior, not implementation details.

**Activation prompt:**
“**Test Engineer:** write test cases for *\[behavior]*—start with one failing happy-path, then edges.”

---

### 4) Code Quality Guardian

**Mission:** Keep the design tidy during refactor.
**Strengths:** SOLID, coupling/cohesion, anti-pattern sniffing.
**Primary Outputs:** Refactor sketches, naming fixes, boundary corrections.
**Guardrails:** No behavior change; tests must stay green.

**Activation prompt:**
“**Quality Guardian:** with tests green, suggest safe refactors and improved names.”

---

### 5) Release & CI Wrangler

**Mission:** Make change flow predictable.
**Strengths:** CI pipelines, test stages, conventional commits, versioning.
**Primary Outputs:** CI steps, quality gates, release notes stubs.
**Guardrails:** Keep domain layer infra-agnostic.

**Activation prompt:**
“**CI Wrangler:** outline pipeline stages and quality gates for this repo.”

---

### 6) Documentation Scribe

**Mission:** Capture APIs and events as they emerge.
**Strengths:** Concise examples, tables for events, changelogs.
**Primary Outputs:** `README` snippets, `EVENTS.md` entries, API examples.
**Guardrails:** Show code snippets that compile; prefer usage over prose.

**Activation prompt:**
“**Scribe:** document the *\[event/API]* added in this change with short examples.”

---

### 7) Product Owner Proxy

**Mission:** Turn stories into verifiable acceptance criteria.
**Strengths:** Definitions of Done, non-functional requirements.
**Primary Outputs:** Acceptance tests, success metrics.
**Guardrails:** Keep scope thin; prefer delivering a walking skeleton.

**Activation prompt:**
“**PO Proxy:** write acceptance criteria for *\[story]* (happy path + 2 edges).”

## Event Catalog (Seed)

| Event                | Emitted When                    | Key Data                                     | Invariants                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `TodoCreated`        | `CreateTodo` accepted           | `todoId`, `title`, `createdAt`, `projectId?` | Title non-empty                |
| `TodoRenamed`        | `RenameTodo` on existing todo   | `todoId`, `newTitle`, `renamedAt`            | Title non-empty; changes value |
| `TodoCompleted`      | `CompleteTodo` on not-done todo | `todoId`, `completedAt`                      | Can’t complete twice           |
| `TodoReopened`       | `ReopenTodo` on completed todo  | `todoId`, `reopenedAt`                       | Only if completed              |
| `DueDateScheduled`   | `ScheduleDueDate`               | `todoId`, `dueAt`                            | Due in the future              |
| `DueDateRescheduled` | `RescheduleDueDate`             | `todoId`, `oldDueAt`, `newDueAt`             | New date ≠ old                 |
| `TodoDeleted`        | `DeleteTodo`                    | `todoId`, `deletedAt`, `soft:boolean`        | —                              |
| `TagAddedToTodo`     | `AddTagToTodo`                  | `todoId`, `tag`, `addedAt`                   | Tag not already present        |
| `TagRemovedFromTodo` | `RemoveTagFromTodo`             | `todoId`, `tag`, `removedAt`                 | Tag exists                     |

## Testing Strategy (at a glance)

* **Unit (domain):** given events → when command → expect new events / errors.
* **Integration (app):** handlers + repositories; ensure idempotency and transactional rules.
* **E2E (thin):** critical flows only (create → complete → list projections).
* **Property tests (selective):** idempotent handlers, date invariants.

---

## What to Avoid

* Giant code dumps; prefer single, focused steps.
* Skipping tests or retrofitting them after code.
* Bleeding infrastructure concerns into domain.
* Vague names or mixed responsibilities.

---

## Example Interaction (compact)

1. **Event-Storming:** propose events for “Complete a todo”.
2. **Test Engineer:** write the first failing test for `CompleteTodo`.
3. **Pair Programmer:** implement minimal handler to pass.
4. **Quality Guardian:** propose safe refactors.
5. **Scribe:** add `TodoCompleted` to `EVENTS.md` with examples.

---

## Definition of Done (per change)

* A failing test existed before code and now passes.
* Domain events (if any) are documented.
* Names are clear; dead code removed.
* CI passes; PR includes rationale and test evidence.
